# Legendary-bat-scripts
A small compilation of bat scripts I wrote using Legendary for epic games launcher.


The Game scripts can be copied and pasted for diferent games, The only thing you need to do is edit.

``
legendary launch *Game id*
``

Replace the game id with the corresponding id.

You can find the game id with the installed games bat.

It is required to install the [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) pip library.
